            <p>Let's clear the confusion and bust some myths that girls have been told for years! Because facts > fear. 💪</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-3">🔸 Myth 1: You shouldn't exercise during your period</h3>
            <p>🧠 Reality: Light to moderate exercise like walking, yoga, or stretching can actually help relieve cramps and boost mood due to endorphins.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-3">🔸 Myth 2: You lose a lot of blood during your period</h3>
            <p>🧠 Reality: The average amount of blood lost is only about 30–80 ml (2–6 tablespoons).</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-3">🔸 Myth 3: You can't get pregnant during your period</h3>
            <p>🧠 Reality: It's less likely, but still possible if you have a short cycle and sperm survives in the body.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-3">🔸 Myth 4: Periods should always come every 28 days</h3>
            <p>🧠 Reality: Normal cycles range from 21 to 35 days, especially for teens.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-3">🔸 Myth 5: You shouldn't bathe or wash hair during periods</h3>
            <p>🧠 Reality: Totally false. Warm baths can actually ease cramps.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-3">🔸 Myth 6: Tampons break your virginity</h3>
            <p>🧠 Reality: Virginity is a social concept, not a physical one.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mt-3">🔸 Myth 7: You should hide your period</h3>
            <p>🧠 Reality: No! Talk about it. It's normal and healthy. 💕</p>
